1) Assume there is a table called Multicust, with all of the same column definitions
as Salespeople. Write a command that inserts all salespeople with more than one
customer into this table.
sol
===
create table multicust as
select * from salespeople;
select sname, customer.snum from customer, salespeople
 where salespeople.snum=customer.snum group by sname having count(customer.snum)>1;

2) Write a command that deletes all customers with no current orders.
sol
===
delete from customer where cnum<=(select ifnull(cnum,0) from customer where cnum is null);
error: You can't specify target table 'customer' for update in FROM clause

3) Write a command that increases by twenty percent the commissions of all
salespeople with total orders above Rs. 3,000.
sol
===
select salespeople.sname,sum(orders.amt*0.20) "inc comm" from orders,salespeople
 where orders.snum=salespeople.snum and amt>3000 group by sname;
