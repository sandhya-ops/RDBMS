select * from orders where cnum=(select cnum from customer where cname='cisneros');

2) Write a query that produces the names and ratings of all customers who have
above-average orders.

===
select cname,rating from customers where cnum=(select cnum from orders where amt>avg(amt));

3) Write a query that selects the total amount in orders for each salesperson for
whom this total is greater than the amount of the largest order in the table.
sol
